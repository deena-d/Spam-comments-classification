# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a simple SMS spam classifier built using Streamlit.

## Overview

The  Spam Classifier uses a machine learning model to predict whether a given  message is spam or not. It preprocesses the input text, vectorizes it using TF-IDF, and then makes predictions using a trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit 0.88.0
- NLTK 3.6.5
- scikit-learn 0.24.2

## Datasets

The Spam Collection dataset is used for training and testing the model. It can be downloaded from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit application by executing `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
5. Enter an  message in the input field and click the "Predict" button to see if it's spam or not.
